# How to install Reservoir

1. Download Drupal 8
2. Download Reservoir
3. Move Reservoir into Drupal 8's `profiles` directory in the Drupal root
4. Install Drupal 8 â€” during the second step of the installation process, you'll be able to choose the _Reservoir_ installation profile




# Future

We'll add drush `make` files so Drupal.org can build a distribution, as well as a `composer.json` file.

For now, this is just an [installation profile](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/creating-distributions/how-to-write-a-drupal-8-installation-profile), not a distribution.
